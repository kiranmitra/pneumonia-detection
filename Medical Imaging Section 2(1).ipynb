Convolutional neural networks are networks that process images much like our visual system does -- by using this technique called 'convolutions'. We won't go too much into the details here or how it's implemented in tensorflow. If you'd like more details, you can try the optional activity out below!\n","\n","Otherwise, we provide tensorflow/keras wrappers around both Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks\n","### Creating Models\n","\n","To create our multilayer perceptrons with our wrapper:\n","```\n","dense = DenseClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes = (2,2))\n","```\n","* hidden_layer_sizes: the number of neurons in each hidden layer\n","* epochs: the number of times that our network trains on the whole training manual\n","\n","\n","To create a convolution neural network:\n","```\n","cnn = CNNClassifier(num_hidden_layers = 3)\n","```\n","* num_hidden_layers: the number of hidden layers \n","\n","### Fitting and Scoring\n","\n","There are default parameters to `.fit` you can call:\n","\n","```\n","model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs = 100, validation_data = (test_data, test_labels), shuffle = True, callbacks = [monitor])\n","```\n","\n","The `shuffle` parameter is important for shuffling the training data before each epoch. The `monitor` callback is used to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. Do not change these parameters!\n","\n","To get your testing scores, use \n","\n","```\n","score = model.evaluate(train_data, train_labels, verbose=0)\n","```\n","\n","Then `score[0]` will be test loss and `score[1]` will be test accuracy.\n","\n","### Plotting\n","\n","After fitting your model, you can plot the training and test accuracy over time. First, run your model again with the `.fit` method, except this time you're going to save it as a variable:  \n","\n","```\n","model_history = model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs = 100, validation_data = (test_data, test_labels), shuffle = True, callbacks = [monitor])\n","```\n","\n","Then, you can look at the plot with with `plot_acc(model_history)`.\n","\n","\n","**Question: What do you observe of the training and test accuracy over the training epochs?** \n","\n","Discuss this with your group and your instructor.
